Ensuring the information security of cyber-physical systems is one of the most complex problems in a wide range of defenses against cyber-attacks. The aim of this paper is to analyse and classify existing research papers on the security of cyber-physical systems. Philosophical issues of cyber-physical systems are raised. Their influence on the aspects of people's lives is investigated. The principle of cyber-physical system operation is described. The main difficulties and solutions in the estimation of the consequences of cyber-attacks, attacks modeling and detection and the development of security architecture are noted. The main types of attacks and threats against cyber-physical systems are analysed. A tree of attacks on cyber-physical systems is proposed. The future research directions are shown."
